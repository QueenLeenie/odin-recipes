<h2>Description</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1.2 lb boneless rib eye</li>
    <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>10 oz mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
    <li>dijon mustard</li>
    <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
    <li>10 oz egg noodle</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Use your fist (or rolling pin or mallet) to flatten the steaks to about 3/4cm / 1/3" thick. Slice into 5mm / 1/5" strips (cut long ones in half), discarding excess fat.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet over high heat. Scatter half the beef in the skillet, QUICKLY spread it with tongs. Leave untouched for 30 seconds until browned. Turn beef quickly (as best you can!). Leave untouched for 30 seconds to brown. Immediately remove onto a plate. Don't worry about pink bits and that it will be raw inside.</li>
    <li>Add remaining oil and repeat with remaining beef.</li>
    <li>Turn heat down to medium high. Add butter, melt. Then add onions, cook for 1 minute, then add mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Cook mushrooms until golden. Scrape bottom of fry pan to get all the golden bits off (this is flavour!).</li>
    <li>Add flour, cook, stirring for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add half the broth while stirring. Once incorporated, add remaining broth.</li>
    <li>Stir, then add sour cream and mustard. Stir until incorporated (don't worry if it looks split, sour cream will "melt" as it heats).</li>
    <li>Bring to simmer ,then reduce heat to medium low. Once it thickens to the consistency of pouring cream (3 - 5 minutes), adjust salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Add beef back in (including plate juices). Simmer for 1 minute, then remove from stove immediately.</li>
    <li>Serve over pasta or egg noodles</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Cake made easily in a cast iron skillet.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple rings</li>
    <li>¼ cup water, or as needed</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix (such as Betty Crocker Super Moist)</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 large egg whites</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups brown sugar</li>
    <li>7 maraschino cherries</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Drain canned pineapple into a 1-cup measure. Add water if needed to measure 1 cup. Set aside juice and 7 pineapple rings for the cake. Set any remaining juice and rings aside for another use.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a 10- or 11-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>While butter is melting, combine cake mix, reserved 1 cup pineapple juice, vegetable oil, and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove melted butter from the heat and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over top until all butter is covered. Arrange 6 pineapple rings around the outer edge of the skillet and the remaining ring in the center without overlapping. Place a maraschino cherry into the center of each pineapple ring. Pour cake batter over the pineapples.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool in the skillet for 10 minutes; don't let the cake cool too much or it will stick to the pan.</li>
    <li>Run an offset spatula around the edges to gently loosen cake. Place a plate over the skillet, then flip and carefully turn the warm cake out onto a plate. Transfer any fruit or glaze that sticks in the skillet back to the cake.</li>
